Question:explain the method of calculating the circumference of the earth given by Eratosthenes.
 he firstly calculated the angle between the sunlight and the vertical line of the ground in alexender at noon and found that the angle is 7.2 degree,1/50 of the whole circle.
He found that the angle is the same as the angle between alexander and syene,so he let a tuodui complete a trip and obtained the distance between the two places.
he multiplied the distance with 50, getting the circumstance of the earth.
algorithms:define deg as the degree between the two places
define dis as the distance between the two places.
define cir as the circumstance of the earth
cir=dis*(360/deg)
now we have the circumstance of the earth and we can easily obtain the radius of the earth by using the formula c=2pi*r
define r as the radius of the earth
r=cir/(2pi)
